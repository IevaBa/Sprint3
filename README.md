# Sprint 3 – Online Shop

- Sprint 3 is an Online Shop example I have done throughout my studies at BIT.
- Entire content was built for educational purposes and none of the items is available on the market.

## Description

- To finalise my project, I used Bootstrap framework v5.1.3.
- All commands were made using Git CLI.
- Project consists of two branches:
  - **main** – a basic version of the website and includes 4 pages;
  - **new_arrivals** – upgrated version with additional content and one more page.

## Launch procedure

Project was made using localy stored Bootstrap library. To open my project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone my Github repository [Sprint3](https://github.com/IevaBa/Sprint3.git). ![](img/readme/clone.png)
2. Open your terminal, type <span style="background:#DEDEDE; border-radius:5px; padding: 2px">git clone</span>, paste the URL you cloned and press Enter.
3. Bravo! You already have your local clone.
4. Now download Compiled CSS and JS Bootstrap library file. [Download](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/download/)
5. Extract downloaded file.
6. Rename the library folder named "bootstrap-5.1.3-dist" to just “bootstrap” and store it in the "index.html" file directory.
7. Open "index.html" file using your preferred internet browser.
8. Enjoy 😊
