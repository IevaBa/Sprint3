# Sprint 3 ‚Äì Online Shop

- Sprint 3 is an Online Shop example I have done throughout my studies at BIT.
- Entire content was built for educational purposes and none of the items is available on the market.

## Description

- To finalise my project, I used Bootstrap framework v5.1.3.
- All commands were made using Git CLI.
- Project consists of two branches:
  - **main** ‚Äì a basic version of the website and includes 4 pages;
  - **new_arrivals** ‚Äì upgrated version with additional content and one more page.
